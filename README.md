## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight (EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
