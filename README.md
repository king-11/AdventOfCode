## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight (EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

## History

I have been doing Advent of Code since **2020** when I first heard about during the period of *COVID*. Since then every year I try to learn a **new language** by doing AoC.

>Learning new language is not about just adding one more language into my belt but for me its more about identifying patterns that can be used across them and appreciating each one.

| Year | Programming Language | Stars |
|:----:|:--------------------:|:-----:|
| [2020](./2020) | Node JS | 27 |
| [2021](./2021) | Go | 37 |
| [2022](./2022) | Rust | 33 |
| [2023](./2023) | Kotlin | 15 |

I am doing a full time job now so it becomes a little difficult to find time everyday to do these problems but heck I am gonna try my best because I enjoy this festive problem solving.

## Story of 2024

The Chief Historian is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.

As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a star. They figure the Chief Historian must be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get fifty stars on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
