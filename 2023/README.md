## Story

Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.

You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all fifty stars by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

## Experience

Fantasic Fourth year, after being one of those *Java haters* I finally decided to take one of the JVM languages out for a spin. It was gonna be Kotlin because I had seen my friend's solution on how **succinct** and beautiful they can be. Also one more reason was my manager made me understand that Java does get the _job done_ and has a built a lot of __optimizations__ over the years. But one thing, it is **bloated**, when there are many ways to do one thing it becomes difficult. Given I was doing a full time job it was a little difficult for me to solve problem everyday but I tried my best :)
