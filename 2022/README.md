## Story

Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

## Experience

This was my third year and a lot of my juniors from [Club of Programmers](https://github.com/COPS-IITBHU) participated with me. I did it in Rust because I wanted to experience it first hand and make my decision about how good it is and it proved to be super good a little strict (have to battle with compiler) but atleast I won't face issues in production. It was physically a little difficult for me this time because I just started coding after my accident and it wasn't possible for me to sit through long sessions of coding.
